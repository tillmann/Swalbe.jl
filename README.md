## Thin film simulations using lattice Boltzmann :rainbow: :ocean:

Why is a thin film solver called **Swalbe.jl** you may ask?

The idea is to use the [*lattice Boltzmann method (LBM)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods) and all its benefits (easy to code, vast amount of literature and scalability) to simulate thin liquid film flows.
Instead of reinventing the wheel we make use of a class of lattice Boltzmann models that were build to simulate shallow water problems.

  - short description of model (Salmon, 1999, [pdf](http://pordlabs.ucsd.edu/rsalmon/salmon.1999a.pdf)) (not the fish :fish:),
  - short description of model (Dellar, ????, [pdf](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/dellar/papers/LBshallow.pdf)) and
  - short description of model (van Thang et al., ???? ,[pdf](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01625073/document)).

Thus the name of the package **S**hallow **WA**ter **L**attice **B**oltzmann slov**E**r or **Swalbe**.

Of course using a plain shallow water model will not work to simulate thin film dynamics, that is the reason we build our own model.
Now the main difference is that we throw away most of the shallow water parts by assuming they are small as compared to thin film relevant things, e.g. the substrate fluid interaction.
The full explanation of the model with some benchmarks can be found in our paper (Zitz et al., ????, [pdf](http://pub.hi-ern.de/publications/2019/ZSMDH19/2019-ThinFilm-PRE.pdf)) (the C/C++ OpenACC codebase there has not been further developed)

## How to **get** 

First of all you need a *[Julia](https://julialang.org/)* installation at version 1.6 or higher. It further depends on the [CUDA.jl](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/) library and a NVIDIA graphics card. 

**Swalbe.jl** is a registered package of the *Julia* package manager.
The only thing you have to do is to add the package to your *Julia* environment with: 

```julia
julia> ] add Swalbe
```

You can also clone the repo and activate the package inside the julia **REPL**.
First you need to go the Swalbe directory and open a **REPL**

```bash
git clone <repo-url> swalbe.jl
cd swalbe.jl
julia
```

now you can activate the package with

```julia
julia> ] activate .
```

To check if the package works you can run the test suite with

```julia
julia> ] test Swalbe
```

All tests can be found in [test/](https://github.com/Zitzeronion/Swalbe.jl/tree/master/test), but do not expect too many comments.

Still especially the file [test/simulate.jl](https://github.com/Zitzeronion/Swalbe.jl/blob/master/test/simulate.jl) is worth a look.

## How to **use** 

The idea of **Swalbe.jl** is to script your thin film simulation, based on a lattice Boltzmann iteration.
That is why most core functions can be easily extended, or used out of the box.

Now, load the package with the `using` keyword.

```julia
julia> using Swalbe
```

this might take a minute, don't be alarmed if it takes more than ten seconds.

Alternatively we can use [DrWatson](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl) (super cool package to manage scientific computing with *Julia*) and use the `@quickactivate :Swalbe` macro.

The package has reached a stable release with version 0.1.
All tools needed for running a numerical experiment are tested and usable.
I am currently writing a paper for which all experiments were done with this package :blush:.
